# HTML-CSS-Portfolio
 First Portfolio

I created this Portfolio only using HTML and CSS to practice
and really hone my web development skills with just the basics
before I decide to implement Javascript or some other dynamic
language.

The design itself is based off of a book I just finished reading
titled "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir. I really enjoyed the book
and loved the aesthetic of the cover itself. So while i'm not
exactly using the same colors and text, I did want to empulate it
some way/some how.
